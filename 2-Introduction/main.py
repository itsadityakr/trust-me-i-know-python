# This is a single-line comment in Python.
# Comments are useful for explaining code and making it more readable.

# Python follows indentation rules instead of using semicolons (';') or curly braces ('{}') like other programming languages.
# Proper indentation is crucial for defining code blocks.

""" 
This is a multi-line comment (also called a docstring).
They are often used to document functions, classes, and modules.
"""

# Docstrings can span multiple lines and are enclosed within triple quotes (''' or """)

# Printing output to the console using the print() function
print("Hi, this is a print statement")  # Prints a string message
print(8)  # Prints an integer value

# Using f-string (formatted string literals) to embed variables inside a string.
# f-strings are prefixed with 'f' and allow direct variable interpolation within curly braces.

str1 = "How are you?"  # A string is a sequence of characters enclosed within single ('') or double ("") quotes.
print(f'{str1}')  # Using f-string to print the value of the variable 'str1'
