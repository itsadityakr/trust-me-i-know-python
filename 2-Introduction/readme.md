# Comments and Printing 

## Single-Line Comments  
A single-line comment in Python starts with the `#` symbol. Comments are used to explain code and make it more readable.  

Example:  
A comment explaining a piece of code is written like this:  
`# This is a single-line comment in Python.`  

## Multi-Line Comments (Docstrings)  
Python supports multi-line comments using triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`). These are also known as docstrings and are often used to document functions, classes, and modules.  

Example:  
A multi-line comment can be written as:  
```  
"""  
This is a multi-line comment.  
It is useful for documentation purposes.  
"""  
```  
Docstrings can span multiple lines and help in providing detailed descriptions of the code.  

## Indentation in Python  
Python does not use semicolons (`;`) or curly braces (`{}`) to define code blocks, unlike many other programming languages. Instead, it uses indentation (whitespace) to structure code properly. Proper indentation is essential for Python code to work correctly.  

## Printing Output to the Console  
Python provides the `print()` function to display output on the console. It can print different types of data, such as strings and numbers.  

Example:  
- `print("Hi, this is a print statement")` → Displays a string message.  
- `print(8)` → Displays an integer value.  

## Using f-Strings for String Formatting  
Python allows embedding variables inside strings using **f-strings** (formatted string literals). These are prefixed with `f` and use curly braces `{}` to insert variable values directly.  

Example:  
- Declaring a string variable: `str1 = "How are you?"`  
- Printing the variable using an f-string: `print(f'{str1}')`  

This method makes it easy to format and display text dynamically.
