# Introduction  

## 1. What is Python?  
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language designed for ease of use and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991. Python follows an object-oriented and dynamically typed approach.  

## 2. How Python is Run?  
Python is an interpreted language, meaning it is executed line by line using the Python interpreter.  

### Steps in Execution:  
1. The Python source code is written in a text editor and saved as a `.py` file.  
2. The interpreter reads and converts the code into an intermediate bytecode file (`.pyc`).  
3. The Python Virtual Machine (PVM) executes this bytecode.  

A simple Python program can print a message to the console using the `print` function.  

## 3. Why is Python Used?  
Python is widely used in various fields, including:  
- Web Development (Django, Flask)  
- Data Science and Machine Learning (Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow)  
- Automation and Scripting  
- Game Development  
- Cybersecurity  
- Embedded Systems  

## 4. Advantages of Python over C, C++, and Java  

### Simplicity  
Python has a simpler syntax, making it more readable and easier to write compared to C++ and Java.  

### Dynamic Typing  
Python does not require variable type declarations, unlike C++ or Java. This makes development more flexible.  

### Interpreted Language  
Python does not require compilation like C and C++, which speeds up development but may slow execution.  

### Extensive Libraries  
Python provides powerful libraries for various tasks, such as NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow, reducing the need for manual implementation of features.  

### Memory Management  
Python handles memory automatically using garbage collection, whereas in C++, memory management must be done manually.  

### Platform Independence  
Python code can run on any operating system without modification, while C++ and Java may require recompilation.  

### Less Code  
Python allows developers to achieve the same functionality with fewer lines of code compared to C++ and Java.  

For example, swapping two numbers in Python can be done in a single line, whereas in C++, additional steps are required.  

## 5. Disadvantages of Python Compared to C, C++, and Java  

### Speed  
Python is slower than C and C++ because it is interpreted rather than compiled.  

### High Memory Usage  
Due to dynamic typing and automatic memory management, Python consumes more memory than C and C++.  

### Weak in Mobile Development  
Java is widely used for Android development, whereas Python is not a preferred choice for mobile applications.  

### Limited Multithreading  
Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) restricts true parallel execution, whereas C++ and Java support multithreading more efficiently.  

## Conclusion  
Python is an excellent language for beginners due to its simplicity and readability. It is widely used in automation, data science, web development, and scripting. However, for applications where speed is crucial, C and C++ are better choices. For mobile development, Java remains the preferred language.  

## Running Python Code  
To execute a Python script named `main`, save the file with a `.py` extension and run it using the command:  
**python main.py**
